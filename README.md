# Football & NBA Predictor - Sample Project

This is a minimal, working example of a Streamlit web app that predicts match outcomes for a sample football dataset and a sample NBA dataset.
It uses synthetic sample data and very simple models to give you a ready-to-run project so you can try Streamlit + GitHub deployment quickly.

## What's included
- `data/raw/football_matches_sample.csv` — synthetic football matches
- `data/raw/nba_games_sample.csv` — synthetic NBA games
- `models/` — pre-trained simple models (joblib)
- `src/` — simple data loader and training script
- `app.py` — Streamlit app
- `requirements.txt`

## How to run locally (Windows/macOS/Linux)
1. Install Python 3.10+ and Git.
2. Clone or unzip this project.
3. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - `python -m venv venv`
   - `source venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
4. Install dependencies:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the Streamlit app:
   - `streamlit run app.py`
6. The app will open at `http://localhost:8501` by default.

## Notes
- The models and data are intentionally simple for demonstration purposes.
- Replace the sample CSVs with real historical data and improve feature engineering and models for production use.
